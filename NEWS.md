# inshiny (development version)

* Modified check_tags() so it only runs during continuous integration. This is
  a change in internal details that doesn't affect users of the package, done 
  to move the onus of keeping this package accurate onto myself rather than
  Shiny developers. Thanks to @schloerke who raised this in PR #1 and issue #2!

# inshiny 0.1.1

* Bug fix: updated to work with the newly released shiny 1.12.0.

# inshiny 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
