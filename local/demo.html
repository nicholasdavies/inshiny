It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period
was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
degree of comparison only. <span class="pseudo-wrapper"><input type="text"
value="comparison only"></span>. There were a king with a large jaw and
a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king
with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.
In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State
preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for
ever.
