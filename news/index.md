# Changelog

## inshiny (development version)

- Modified check_tags() so it only runs during continuous integration.
  This is a change in internal details that doesn’t affect users of the
  package, done to move the onus of keeping this package accurate onto
  myself rather than Shiny developers. Thanks to
  [@schloerke](https://github.com/schloerke) who raised this in PR
  [\#1](https://github.com/nicholasdavies/inshiny/issues/1) and issue
  [\#2](https://github.com/nicholasdavies/inshiny/issues/2)!
